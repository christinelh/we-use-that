## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Colin Percival](http://www.daemonology.net/blog/), founder (and 100% owner) of [Tarsnap](http://www.tarsnap.com/).  Tarsnap is an online backup service for [UNIX](http://www.unix.org/) and UNIX-like systems with a heavy emphasis on security. I created it because during my time as [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) Security Officer I wanted to have reliable backups while making sure that I would not be responsible for as-yet-unannounced security vulnerabilities being leaked.

## What is your technology stack?

Tarsnap is built on [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/), non-blocking network I/O, C, shell scripts, C, GNU  Autotools ([Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/), [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)), and more C.  I would not be surprised if Tarsnap is the most C-oriented startup around -- where other people use a web framework, a scripting language and a database, I just code the dynamic parts of the Tarsnap website as CGI scripts written in C.

Underlying all the C is FreeBSD (for the systems I run) or pretty much any UNIX or UNIX-like operating system (for the client code Tarsnap users run).

The Tarsnap client code uses [libarchive](http://libarchive.github.com/) to generate backups, and [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) for some cryptographic primitives. For deriving cryptographic keys from passphrases to protect Tarsnap's key files, I use [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html). The rest of the client code is all C which I wrote specifically for Tarsnap.

The Tarsnap server code is like the client code except without libarchive and with Amazon S3 (where all the data is ultimately stored).

The Tarsnap web server uses [stunnel](http://www.stunnel.org/) to unwrap SSL connections (I will probably switch to [stud](https://github.com/bumptech/stud) at some point), and [Apache HTTPD](http://httpd.apache.org/) to serve up the
site.

Tarsnap's email setup is built around [qmail](http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html), with mailing lists managed by [ezmlm](http://cr.yp.to/ezmlm.html). Mail is sent between my servers via [spiped](http://www.tarsnap.com/spiped.html) pipes.

I use [djbdns](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html) for recursive DNS resolution and caching.

## What software do you use to run your business?

As mentioned above, all backup data is ultimately stored on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). [Amazon SimpleDB](http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/) is used for usage accounting.

I use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to monitor traffic to the Tarsnap website, but only on the non-HTTPS side, since [I don't trust Google Analytics on my secure site](http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-09-01-Iran-forged-the-wrong-SSL-certificate.html).

My internal monitoring server uses [Twilio](http://twilio.com/) to send me SMS messages and (if I don't respond fast enough) to phone me if it notices any problems.

Tarsnap payments are processed using [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/) and [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/).

Outgoing email is sent via [sendgrid](http://sendgrid.com/).

Tarsnap authoritative DNS is served by [Amazon Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/), while 

All of the above (except the client code, of course) happens on FreeBSD instances running in the [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) US-East region; except the monitoring system, which is in the US-West-2 region, and the web server, which is hosted by [RootBSD](http://www.rootbsd.net/) (but will probably move to EC2 at some point -- RootBSD is fantastic, but standardizing on EC2 will make it easier to keep track of everything).

## What business software do you most wish existed?

I would pay for software which I could pipe cron emails into which would figure out what was "normal" and alert me to anything "abnormal".  I get a lot of emails from cron jobs, and I don't look at them nearly as carefully as I should.
